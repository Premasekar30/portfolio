**Features**

- **Responsive Contact Form**: A form designed to adapt to different screen sizes, ensuring that visitors can contact me from any device.
- **JavaScript Form Validation**: Basic form validation ensures that users enter valid information before submitting their message.
- **Interactive UI**: The contact form includes smooth transitions, animations, and hover effects for a more engaging user experience.
- **Email Submission**: Currently, the form is set up with front-end validation. In future updates, I plan to integrate back-end support to handle email submissions via a server or third-party service.

## **Technologies Used**

- **HTML5**: For structuring the form elements.
- **CSS3**: For styling the form, making it responsive, and adding visual effects.
- **JavaScript**: For form validation and dynamic functionality, ensuring that users provide the necessary details before submission.
